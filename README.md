Advent of Code challenges 2023, exercising an unmerged feature proposal in Scala 3 for tuples with labelled fields

## Requirements

- build locally Scala 3 compiler from this PR https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/pull/19075, for convenience I published it locally under the name `3.4.0-RC1-namedtuples-bin-SNAPSHOT`
- you will need [Scala CLI](https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org)
- run `scala-cli setup-ide .` on this repository, then open in your favorite [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/)-enabled editor
